This is the readme for the models associated with the paper:

Hajos M, Hoffmann WE, Orban G, Kiss T, Erdi P (2004) Modulation of
septo-hippocampal Theta activity by GABAA receptors: an experimental
and computational approach. Neuroscience 126:599-610

These models were previously available as a web link to a model as
shown in the weblink folder; the .g and .p files in this archive were
from a file called theta.tgz which when expanded created the
theta_download folder available in this archive.

The papers complete supplementary material is also available in this
archive (see suppl_mat.pdf).
